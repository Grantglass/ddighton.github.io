This project came out of a course I designed for English and communication majors at NCSU. The course focuses on providing students with a foundation in rhetorical theory and social movement theory and involves collaborative and individual assignments that scaffold understanding rhetoric as it happens and circulates. In part of the course, students collect Twitter data using [TAGS](https://tags.hawksey.info/get-tags/), then find creative way to analyze and remix social media data using it as an inventional resource for intervening in a contemporary social and political problem. Students chose topics related to fake news, hashtag movements like #metoo, and the Dreamer Movement that emerged from revoking the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Through technological modes of analysis and remediation like Tableau, Twine, and Kahoot and handmade and embodied forms of making and performance, participants applied their theoretical knowledge of rhetoric and social movements to engage the local campus community and offer interventions to address social and political problems . 

Any part of this syllabus is available for others to use or modify. If you do so, please let me know at desireedighton@gmail.com. The images below are of student projects reproduced with their permission.

The first photo is of a collaborative protest art piece that remediated #metoo by inviting local participation and circulating across campus, residing for extended periods in the Caldwell Lounge, the Women’s Center, and the GLBT Center. 

The second photo is a screenshot of a project that use [Timeline JS](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) to tell the history of how the #TakeAKnee movement happened.

The third photo depicts part of “a digital maze” students created in NCSU Libraries' [Visualization Studio](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/spaces/visualization-studio) by combining an audio interview with an anonymous DACA recipient and a series of immersive videos and visualizations depicting the Twitter conversation around #DACA. Reflecting on their projects, these students stated, “we understand that one documentary will not spark the change that we want to see regarding the immigration rights movement, but our voices and ideas are now part of a larger public screen. In this way, we hope to continue to circulate our ideas and knowledge of the DREAMer movement crafted through careful attention to rhetorical strategies and the movement's needs by sharing our presentation through different platforms and to different audiences into the future.
