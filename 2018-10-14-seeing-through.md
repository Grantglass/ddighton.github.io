The visualizations in this collection demonstrate some of the ways in which I’ve collected and attempted to understand a large Twitter dataset around the keyword "gentrification". From February 2016 to February 2018, I used used the Social Feed Manager application developed by George Washington University Libraries to collect tweets realtime from Twitter’s API. Over two years, I collected approximately two million tweets (with associated metadata) containing the keyword "gentrification", plus all tweets from users who were extermely active in the gentrication conversation on Twitter.
 
This bigram visualization was generated by processing a random sample of this data using R libraries for frequency analysis, modifying Kris Shaffer’s example in “Mining Twitter data with R, TidyText, and TAGS.” Bi-grams are paired word groups and this visualization shows the two-word associations that most frequently occur in an early sample of approximately 200,000 tweets. Generating bigrams became a starting point to identify themes like anti-gentrification resistance and the role of art in gentrification. The bi-grams also allowed me to isolate particular locations like Boyle Heights, Los Angeles, which would eventually constitute the primary case study in my dissertation.  

In early mapping efforts, I used Carto to map the small geolocated sample of tweets (about 80,000) from my larger data collection during Summer 2016 NEH ODH Institute for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities Space and Place in Africana/Black Studies: An Institute on Spatial Humanities Theories, Methods and Practice for Africana Studies. The visualization demonstrates the global spread of the Twitter discussion of gentrification. Unsurprisingly, tweets are most concentrated in urban areas most commonly associated with gentrification, such as those over New York City, Washington D.C., and London, England. The map also reveals how discussion of gentrification has spread to the global South, dappling significant areas in South America, Africa, and Asia.

By using Tableau, I’ve been able to identify the quantitatively significant elements of my dataset, like the most viral tweets and the most active users. Tableau graphs also help to identify important events by showing peaks of activity. These quantitative measures often highlighted events of ad-hoc anti-gentrification activism that circulated through user-generated visual rhetoric like memes and photography.
To explore this data’s relationship to more organized activism, I human coded the Twitter data related to the Latinx anti-gentrification coalition, Defend Boyle Heights (DBH). Many of DBH’s tweets are geolocated, but to improve the accuracy of the location information as well as to trace the movement of DBH through a new materialist lens, I read and human-coded about 1,000 tweets, attached images, and other media to identify precise locations and activities. The early version of this map partially demonstrates DBH’s movement and encounters from 2016-2018, providing implications for how we understand circulation as an assemblage of human, material, and technological processes. On the current map, larger points indicate numerous tweets referencing specific locations, sometimes series of locations, and demonstrates the concentration of physical and digital energies encountering each other these locations. The map is a work in progress that will include incorporating symbology to distinguish between incoming art galleries and other gentrifying businesses and the places made vulnerable by eviction and rising rent prices, as well as the community centers and murals that reflect Boyle Heights' Latinx cultural identities and Chicanx histories. Mapping DBH demonstrates the way in which this group makes visible gentrification’s ties to cultural erasure and human displacement. By including symbols that show DBH’s contribution to gallery and business closings, it also demonstrates how DBH circulates within physical and digital spaces to compose and retain Boyle Heights as a space that reflects their cultural and economic values. Mapping DBH’s followers demonstrates how DBH circulates beyond their Los Angeles neighborhood to build alliances based on a sense of shared heritage and the political priority of their right to exist in their home spaces. 

Subsequent phases of this project will include additional coding for
