I am a Ph.D. candidate in Rhetoric, Communication, and Digital Media at North Carolina State University, where I teach courses in professional writing, digital rhetoric, and writing and rhetorical theory. I am also a research assistant for NCSUâ€™s Campus Writing and Speaking program, an initiative designed to support faculty across campus in integrating writing, speaking, and digital communication into their courses. My research interests are in public writing, rhetorical theory, circulation studies, and feminist digital methodologies. I am particularly interested in the possibilities and implications of social media data research and pedagogies for rhetoric and writing studies.  

My current research involves a collection of over two million tweets and associated metadata around the keyword, "gentrification." Using computational and conventional modes of exploring this data, I work to develop theories and methodologies for working with large social media datasets in a way that addresses and impacts the social, political, and ethical aspects of large social media data research.
